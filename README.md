# 2DOF

* A ciruit with two motors to control the arm robot was made. The reason for using 2 motors were because the arm was able to produce two movements (for 2 joints). 
* The arm robot was analyzed and equations for forward and inverse kinematics were found and converted to a code. 
* The codes and circuit were built using TinkerCad program.
