# 2DOF

The movement of a specific arm robot was analyzed and explained in details in this respirotory: 


Step 1: A ciruit was made using TinkerCad program. 
* Two servo motors to control the arm robot movement were added. 
* Since the power provided from the arduino is not enough to be fed to both servos, an external battery was added. It helps protecting the circuit and the servos.
* The purpose of having a voltage regulator was to supply each servo with 5V in a safety manner. 


Step 2: The arm robot was analyzed and equations for forward and inverse kinematics were found and converted to a code to control the arm. 
*
